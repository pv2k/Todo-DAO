# Todo Web3 APP

Contains the code of todo smart contract and web application built to connect with the contract. User can create a to-do list entry on the goerli blockchain. And later toggle the created entry to complete state or move it to not-done. 
A user can see all the to-do list entries created by all the users, but he can only toggle the entries that are created by himself. 

Yet to implement - Listening to events emitted from the contract and, in response, refreshing the page whenever a new entry is made.

To run on the local machine
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```
